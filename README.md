# Offbeats 2.0 — Travel Itinerary Platform

**Offbeats 2.0** is a travel-focused web application built to help users explore offbeat destinations, especially in mountain regions. It offers a clean interface to discover curated experiences, and in the future, aims to leverage AI to create personalized itineraries.

## 🧭 Project Overview

- A clean and interactive interface for browsing offbeat travel locations.
- Optimized for users looking to escape mainstream tourism.
- Designed with a vision to integrate AI/LLM-based recommendations.

## ⚙️ Features

- Browse and filter travel destinations
- See details including location, difficulty, ideal time to visit
- Admin interface for adding/editing new spots
- Future support for user logins and trip planning

## 🚀 Future Plans

In upcoming versions, this app will:
- Integrate a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to auto-generate travel itineraries based on:
  - Budget
  - Duration
  - Travel style (adventure, peace, spiritual)
  - Interests (trekking, heritage, cuisine, etc.)

This will transform Offbeats 2.0 into a smart travel companion that tailors journeys for every traveler.
